# Tema1Retele
The first project for my Computer Network course.
This program requires an username for loggin in. The valid usernames can be found in TEMA.txt. 
myfind ( file name ) - will give you the path to any file named after the parameter. 
mystat ( file name ) - will provide the file type, file size and permissions.
quit will close the program.
